      This project showcases a Vue.js-based calculator application, highlighting both the
      frameworkâ€™s powerful capabilities and my expertise in web development. The calculator is
      designed to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction,
      multiplication, and division. It also supports percentage calculations and negative number
      operations.
